# Application-of-statistical-techniques-for-the-estimation-of-obesity-levels-dataset
In this project, I applied regression (using R) and classification (using Python) techniques to the dataset obtained from UCI machine learning repository named as 
Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical condition Data Set. I  
implemented the investigated strategies that were suitable for the reference dataset and the 
corresponding applicable optimizations for each task, culminating in a comparison of the 
performance of the resulting models in each area.
